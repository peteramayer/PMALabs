  "readme": "## An OpenType, TrueType, and WOFF parser in JavaScript\n\nThis is a pure JavaScript parser for font files. It supports the two main formats: OpenType and TrueType as well as WOFF.\n\nThe following OpenType tables are currently supported:\n\n* CMAP (only format 0, 4, 12, and 13)\n* head\n* hhea\n* maxp\n* hmtx\n* name\n* OS/2\n* post\n* GSUB (excluding LookupType 5, 6, 7, and 8)\n* GDEF (only the Glyph Class Definitions)\n* gasp\n\nThis roughly corresponds to all the metadata available in most fonts. Future versions of this library will probably support parsing the actual font data (pull requests welcome!). \n\n## Usage\n\nUse Grunt to compile a minimized versions:\n\n    $ grunt\n\nThen include `build/opentype.js` into your page and pass the `opentype.parse` method an `ArrayBuffer` instance:\n\n    var buffer = new ArrayBuffer(...);\n\n    var font = opentype.parse(buffer);\n\nThe `font` variable will now contain a JSON representation of all supported OpenType tables. Later versions of this library will support parsing only select OpenType tables.\n\n## Browser Support\n\nThis library extensively uses `ArrayBuffer`'s, and `DataView`'s so you will need a browser that supports those. Any recent version of Chrome or Firefox will do.\n\n## Copyright and License\n\nThis library is licensed under the three-clause BSD license. Copyright 2013 Bram Stein. All rights reserved.\n",
